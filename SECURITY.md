# Security Policy

devresponsekit is a security-first authentication and multi-tenant application
shell, so we take vulnerability reports seriously and aim to respond quickly.

## Supported versions

Security fixes land on the latest `1.0.x` release and the `main` branch.

| Version         | Supported          |
| --------------- | ------------------ |
| `1.0.x`         | :white_check_mark: |
| `main` (latest) | :white_check_mark: |
| `< 1.0`         | :x:                |

## Reporting a vulnerability

**Please do not open a public issue, PR, or discussion for security
vulnerabilities** — that discloses the problem before a fix is available.

Instead, report privately via **GitHub Security Advisories**:

> [Report a vulnerability](https://github.com/devresponse/devresponsekit/security/advisories/new)

(If private reporting is not enabled on the repository, ask a maintainer to
enable *Settings → Security → Private vulnerability reporting*.)

Please include, as far as you can:

- affected version / commit SHA,
- a description of the issue and its impact,
- reproduction steps or a proof of concept,
- any suggested remediation.

### What to expect

- **Acknowledgement:** we aim to confirm receipt within **5 business days**.
- **Assessment:** we triage the report, confirm severity, and agree a fix
  timeline with you.
- **Fix & disclosure:** we develop the fix privately, release it, and then
  publish a GitHub Security Advisory crediting the reporter (unless you prefer
  to remain anonymous). We support coordinated disclosure and will agree a
  public-disclosure date with you.

## Scope

Reports that bear directly on the security posture are highest priority, e.g.:

- authentication or session bypass (Better Auth integration, the
  `requireSecureSession` boundary),
- cross-tenant isolation breaks (ADR-0001 — an actor reading or mutating data
  outside their organization),
- privilege escalation (RBAC / the `admin.*` permission model, group/role
  conferral, impersonation),
- machine-credential issues (API keys, JWT/JWKS, OAuth client credentials,
  scope intersection),
- SSO handoff abuse (nonce replay, audience confusion),
- injection, SSRF, XSS (including the Markdown docs viewer), or secret leakage.

Out of scope: findings that require a compromised host or database role,
denial-of-service via unrealistic load, and issues solely in third-party
dependencies (report those upstream — though we welcome a heads-up).

## Handling of secrets

Never include real secrets, production credentials, or customer data in a
report. Use redacted examples. See [SECURITY-adjacent configuration guidance in
docs/configuration.md](docs/configuration.md).
